                One idea that I came across that changed my life forever was: children are natural born scientists in that they are
                constantly exploring their environment and taking in new information that they learn from. The problem is that, a lot of adults 
                lose this natural curiousity and their rate of learning significantly decreases as they get older. I identified this as one area 
                of my life that I want to focus on so over the years, I have redeveloped this natural, child-like curiousity and have become 
                extremely passionate about learning. This led me to try my hand at reading, a hobby I once dreaded. What once took a lot of 
                discipline is now second-nature to me, and I am extremely passionate about reading! Below, are some of my favorite books!

               Over the past few years, I've identified my health as one area of my life I'd like to improve. 
               Fundamentally, your body is a machine that, like machinerey in other disciplines, relies on energy from 
               fuel to do work. Since the human body uses food as fuel, it is important to fuel
